									<h2><a href="#">About me</a></h2>
									<p><p>A Salesforce developer on a journey fueled by grit, determination, and a pinch of rural charm.</p>
									<p>Hailing from a remote corner of the world, where opportunities were as scarce as rain in the desert, I learned early on that education was my golden ticket. With only my unwavering determination as my compass, I embarked on a solitary quest for knowledge.</p>
									<p>Despite the odds stacked against me, I emerged victorious, clinching the prestigious gold medal in my undergraduate studies. This triumph opened the doors to the corporate world, leading me to the doorstep of DXC Technology as a Salesforce developer.</p>
									<p>In the bustling halls of DXC, I found my calling. In just a year, I ascended the ranks, from a newbie developer to a seasoned professional, basking in the glory of promotions and accolades. As I took the helm of projects and mentored budding talents, I couldn't help but feel a nostalgic tug at my heartstrings, as if my childhood dreams were unfolding before my very eyes.</p>
									<p>But the hunger for knowledge never waned. Fuelled by an insatiable thirst for growth, I set my sights on the next milestone: a master's degree at Cleveland State University. Now armed with new skills and fresh perspectives, I stand at the threshold of a new chapter, poised to revolutionize the industry with my unique blend of rural wisdom and urban finesse.</p>
									<p>Join me on this exhilarating journey as we embark on a quest to redefine possibilities, one line of code at a time.</p>
